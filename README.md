##  Flash Cards

This is the starter repository for the [Flash Cards](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards) project.

### Learning Goals

* Follow an interaction pattern
* Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
* Write tests
* Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)
* Host code on Github and submit a Pull Request

### Overview
In this project, you will write a program to simulate a set of flash cards. A user will be able to see the questions, make guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

In order to build good habits, weâ€™ve broken the project into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility.
